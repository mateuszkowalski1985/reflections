What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates .git directory and prepares all files to be commited.
We need to initialize before we add files to track

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is sandbox where we chosse files to cmmit. The main value is that we can easily reset the list of files preapred to commit add/remove files as well
