was introduced?

    Show added and removed lines, also changes in lines of code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you are able to track down history of changes and avoid making same mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: 100% control, saving when needed, less space
	Cons: in case of power outage we can get rid of important stuff

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is cool if files impact each other, google docs is great for those whose files do not interact with each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    diff log shows ids and diff history can show what differences were made and their number

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    dunno

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
