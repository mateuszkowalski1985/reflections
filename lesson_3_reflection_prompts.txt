When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am not alone when working. I am working using using different computers etc.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork - between two remote repos (when I am using u=others repo)
clone- between local and remote repo (when I would like to download some remotes locally
branch - between one local repo( when I am creating my own project and working on features, debug

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You are able to work on it offline, and if collaborators break to=he code it is easier to find last working commit

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
IT would be easier to get confused,
collaboration would be very hard
